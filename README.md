Is your subscription to cloud development plan expired, you can extend it <a href="https://iot.tuya.com/cloud/products/apply-extension"> HERE</a><br/>

## Configuration

Enter your apiRegion, apiKey, apiSecret and Search deviceID (This id is used to detect all the other devices), keep the setting 'Data Timeout' disabled.
A deviceID can be found on your IOT account of Tuya got to Cloud => your project => Devices => Pick one of you device ID.
The initial setup of your devices should be done with the app and this plugin will detect/use the same settings and automatically find/add the devices into Domoticz.

## Usage

In the web UI, navigate to the Hardware page. In the hardware dropdown there will be an entry called "TinyTUYA" configure and add the hardware there.

## Test device

I had only a RGBWW light to fully test the script, if there is a fuction missing in the plugin you can provide the json data for you device by edit and running the debug_discovery.py in the tools directory and posted in issues on Github.
